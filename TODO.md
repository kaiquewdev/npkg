# TODO

### Minor

  * Semver for dependency and NodeJS versioning
  * Cross-comparison between engine and dependency versioning
  * Resource obfuscation for epic lulz

### Major

  * Installer customization through config files
  * Windows - .exe - 100%
  * OSX - .app - 100%
  * Unix - .jar - 100% (Possibly look into .rpm and .deb generation)
